# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns
Using Excel to formulate statistical data and uncover trends to assist client
---

Procedure
---
* Raw kickstarter data was imported into an Excel spreadshet.
* Broad Categories were broken down into small subcategories to help us focus on the clients need, which in this case was musical plays in Great Britain.
* Charts were made to visualize the parent category outcomes then broken down to subcategories.
* Data was streamlined using VLOOKUP to create a table showing goal and pledged amounts in relation to their respective average donation and backers.  This can be observed under "Edinburgh Research" tab.
* The above table was used to create a series of useful pivot tables (i.e "Subcategory Statitics" tab).
* Statistics formulas were used to determine the interquartile range of the kickstarter's both goal and pledge data.  A box plot graph was designed with these resulgs as shown below.

Recommendations
---
* Based on the findings, to ensure success with your kickstarter campaign we recommend setting a budget of $3,500.
* One of the factors that contributed to some kickstarters failing is setting their budget goal too high.  We found the greatest failed kickstarter goal dispararities in kickstarters whose goal amounts were above the upper quartile of the dataset.
* The recommendation closely aligns with the upper quartile of pledged amounts which is $3,982.

Additional Takeaway
---
* With the analysis we determined that the majority of successful theater kickstarts took place in 2015 from years 2010-2017.  It would be noteworthy to determine a common denominator of the majority of the successful plays that year.
